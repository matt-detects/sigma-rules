# sigma-rules

This repository contains sample detection rules written in Sigma format and mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

The goal is to demonstrate structured detection logic development and documentation.

---

## Objectives

- Write Sigma detection rules
- Map rules to ATT&CK techniques
- Document detection rationale
- Identify potential false positives
- Consider telemetry dependencies

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- ATT&CK technique alignment
- Behavioral detection logic
- Structured rule documentation
- Detection lifecycle awareness

---

## Example Detection Themes

- Suspicious PowerShell execution
- Credential access patterns
- Abnormal process spawning
- Encoded command execution

---

## Detection Documentation Template

Each rule includes:

- Description
- Log source assumptions
- ATT&CK mapping
- Detection logic
- Potential false positives
- Suggested tuning considerations

---

## Notes

Rules are written for educational and lab purposes using publicly documented techniques.

They are not production-hardened.
